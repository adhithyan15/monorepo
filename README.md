# Adhithya's Monorepo

Hello everyone!! Welcome to my monorepo. All the contents in the repo is organized into the following folders

* Packages - Packages contain reusable code to use for different purposes. These packages are often published in the corresponding package registry for the language. Some of it might not be published. All packages are designed to have no dependencies other than the programming language and its standard library. Each package also contains a demo folder which provides an example of how to use the package.
* Programs - Programs contain code for executables that can be used to perform something. Some programs are totally silly and useless and some might be beneficial.
* Learnings - I am primarily maintaining this repo to learn as much as I can about all different things. I have documented some of these thing in the learnings folder. I will also be writing blogposts about them in my blog at adhithyarajasekaran.com
