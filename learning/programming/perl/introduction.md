# What is Perl?

Perl is a general purpose dynamic interpreted programming language. It was originally designed by Larry Wall to make reporting and processing easier. It has some built in features to make it easy for text processing. There are now two Perl languages now. Raku was originally developed as the next version of Perl 5. But it eventually became its own language.
