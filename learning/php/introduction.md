# Introduction

PHP is a dynamic scripting language designed for server side scripting purposes. Initially, PHP stood for "Personal Home Page" tools. But it was eventually renamed to the recursive name "Hypertext Preprocessor". It is often used along with other open source technologies like `MySQL` (as part of LAMP stack for example) to make web pages and applications.
