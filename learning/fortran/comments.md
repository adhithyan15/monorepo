# Comments

Comments are how most programmers document code.

To add a comment, you need to add one of the following characters in the first column - `c`, `C`, or `*`.

Here are some examples

```fortran
c This is a hello world program
program hello_world
    print *, "Hello World!!!"
end program hello_world
```

```fortran
C This is a hello world program
program hello_world
    print *, "Hello World!!!"
end program hello_world
```

```fortran
* This is a hello world program
program hello_world
    print *, "Hello World!!!"
end program hello_world
```
